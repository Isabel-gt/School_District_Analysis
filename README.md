# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of the Project
The purpose of this project is to assist a person in charge of doing an analysis in a school district in order to showcase trends in school performance as well as comparing the two school types: *Charter* and *Public*. 

The analysis will also include student funding and students standardize math and reading test scores.

## Findings
<p align="justify">When comparing the math and reading tests scores we can make certain statements. One of the statements is that in all the high schools, on average the reading score was higher than the math score. The average of the math results was 64.68 and the reading one was 72.36. 
By taking a closer look at the statistics on all nine graders we can confirm the statement above. It is perceptible that in both, the upper and the lower quartile the reading scores were again higher than the math scores, 69.24 and 66.59 respectively.</p></p>

<p align="justify">Nevertheless, when observing closely to Sullivan High School, the statement mentioned before does not apply, since the score on the math test was higher than the reading one by 29.2 points.</p>

<p align="justify">An important take out of the analysis regarding the tests scores was found when doing a closer examination to the math scores depending on the school types. In the table where this is compared it is shown that in grades 9th, 10th, and 11th the math score was lower in the public schools than in the charter schools. The exception was grade 12th since the math score was higher in the public schools.</p>

<p align="justify">While doing the analysis it was requested to compare the budgets depending on whether the school was Charter or Public. The analysis showed that the public schools have a budget of 911195.56, and the charter ones a budget of 872625.66 which is lower than the budget of public schools.</p>

<p align="justify">Finally, it was found that in the district 8120 students attends to public schools, and 6711 attend to charter schools. This means that in public schools there are 1409 more students than in charter schools.</p>
